# research-profile-diagnostics

This repository was auto-generated from memory/memory.json. It contains:

- PROFILE.md — a concise profile for Junteng Liu with non-conflicting personal, academic, publication, and contact details extracted from memory.
- diagnostics.md — a list of missing fields, duplicates, conflicting dates/titles, and inconsistent naming found in memory/memory.json. Each item cites exact JSON paths in memory and proposes minimal questions to resolve conflicts.

No new facts were added; the files only summarize and diagnose the entries found in memory.
